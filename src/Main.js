// The Main component needs to render at least two copies of a component called HornedBeasts.

// The Main component needs to pass title, imageUrl, and description into each HornedBeast component. For the purpose of todayâ€™s lab, you can pass whatever title, url and description that you want into each HornedBeast commponent.

// The HornedBeast component needs to contain an <h2> that displays the title of the animal, an <img> element with src, alt and title attributes, and a <p> that displays the description.

//The Main component should pass props for the title, image and description to each HornedBeast component. You will find this information in the provided JSON file.
